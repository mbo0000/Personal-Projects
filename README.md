# Data Analytic Portfolio
This github repo contains a series of mini projects that cover data analytic topics I am interested in. Some projects are connected and touch on a single topic while others are standalone projects. 

### Scope:
* Each project will touch on a single unique task. 
* Data from one project can be use in another as supporting materials for a unique topic. 

### Projects:
* __[SQL in BigQuery](https://github.com/mbo0000/Portfolio/tree/main/BigQuerySQL/):__ using SQL and python to perform quick exploratory analysis using Stackoverflow public dataset in BigQuery. 
* __[Text Analysis](https://github.com/mbo0000/Portfolio/tree/main/TextAnalysisWithNLP):__  using NLP(NLTK) package for collecting data of top tools required by potential employers using dataset from the Python Webscraping project. 
* __[Python Webscraping](https://github.com/mbo0000/Portfolio/tree/main/BigQuerySQL/):__ scraping a small sample set using Selenium package for entry level data analyst job posting in the San Francisco Bay Area.    
* (WIP) __Data Visualization:__ .
