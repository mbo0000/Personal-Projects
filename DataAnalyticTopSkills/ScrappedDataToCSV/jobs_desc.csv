Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Our mission is to exponentially improve drug development and the practice of medicine by learning from the care journey of every patient. We do it by developing novel AI and data pipelining technologies that can connect medical centers across the world and make sense of both unstructured and structured clinical data.

There have been many failed attempts to build a similar platform leaving the clinical and research community with one of two options: breadth with low fidelity (structured data) or high fidelity without breadth and scale (brute force abstraction of unstructured data). Our IP is a foundational breakthrough that can understand clinical context at scale and have been validated by marquee pharma and data companies.

Why You Should Join Our Team

Benjamin Franklin once said: ""If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead, either write something worth reading, or do something worth writing."" — at Mendel you can do the latter. There are two things more devastating than learning that you or your loved ones have a terminal illness; getting the wrong treatment or not finding any. At Mendel, we are on a sincere mission to solve many never-solved-before technology challenges that can enable prescribers and drug makers to do their best.

We are also a fast growing Silicon Valley startup that has raised more than $20M from blue chip venture firms, with revenues more than doubling year to year, tons of benefits, on-site gym, child care, educational leaves, mentorship programs and commuter benefits.

At Nuna, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare affordable and accessible for everyone. We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation’s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.

Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.

Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies and health plans, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.

YOUR TEAM

Nuna’s products are built to help deliver value-based care, at scale, across the United States healthcare system. Value-based healthcare is a delivery model where providers are paid based on patient health outcomes, instead of traditional fee for service arrangements, driving delivery of higher quality care for patients at lower cost. Today, value-based care is incredibly difficult to operationalize so we’re making it easier with products that enable automated, accurate, and transparent operation of value-based payments.

YOUR IMPACT

Nuna’s Data Solutions team offers an incredible opportunity to work with the world's largest payers (Blues, CMS, States) to capture their methodologies and requirements, build and configure their model logic, and validate the accuracy of our product to ensure that providers feel they are being fairly measured which will be integral in ensuring that patients are properly cared for.

In this role you'll work cross functionally with engineers, product managers and customer liaisons to expand, adapt and configure Nuna’s data products towards the delivery of accurate and scalable value-based payment solutions. You will also help Nuna’s product and engineering teams understand clients’ needs and pain points in order to inform and drive product roadmaps.

YOUR OPPORTUNITIES
Lead, coordinate, and train team members in supporting and building products for healthcare plans and providers.
Identify and understand client’s needs and pain points in operationalizing value based payment arrangements. Translate and distill them into systematic tactical plans to support scoping and prioritization of development work.
Solicit, interpret, and document client business requirements and value based payment methodologies.
Lead and coordinate the effort to verify and validate Nuna’s implementation of client’s value based payment models
Collaborate with Product Managers, Engineering, and Design to identify and design new ways to extend Nuna’s products to better serve customer needs.
YOU BRING
Bachelor’s degree or above in quantitative or engineering fields (Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Health/Medical Informatics, Computer Science, or similar)
6+ years of experience working with healthcare data paired with a passion to connect with, understand, and shape the healthcare industry.
4+ years of client facing experience in the healthcare industry; Strong oral and written communication skills.

Jennifer Sager
Recruiting Manager at Kairos Aerospace
About Kairos Aerospace

At Kairos Aerospace, we combine innovative aerospace systems with advanced data science. Unlike traditional aerospace companies, we sell information, not hardware - we operate our sensors cost-effectively at continental scale to produce novel data streams about pressing global problems.
First on our list: spotting hard-to-monitor emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change. Since starting continuous survey operations in 2018, Kairos has removed methane emissions equal to over 9.2 million tonnes of CO2e through our work. To put that in perspective, that’s equivalent to over 2 million cars being removed from the roads for a year or shutting down about seventeen 350 MW coal-fired power plants.
We call that a good start.
As a team, we love science and engineering, we love getting our hands dirty with hardware and software, and we love seeing our work make a difference in the real world.
We’ve created a diverse, collaborative, supportive, and fun environment based on integrity and treating people right. So no matter your gender, gender identity, race, age, beliefs, sexual orientation, or disabilities, we welcome you and would like to work with you. :-)
It’s never boring, it’s always challenging, and we’re usually laughing.

ESG Data Analyst

The underlying strength of Kairos’ Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) value proposition is the scale of our coverage. In 2021 Kairos will perform basin-wide analyses in the Permian, DJ, San Juan, San Joaquin, Barnett, and potentially the Anadarko basin. Since starting continuous operations in 2018, we’ve taken the equivalent of over 3.2 M cars off the road. The scope of ESG data analysis will only grow as Kairos scales with all ESG products needing to meet Kairos’ data fidelity standards.

The ESG Data Analyst is a strategist who uses Kairos data to produce important facts, numbers, and information for teams across the company. As such, their work touches most departments and executives. This is a high impact position. Our ESG Data Analyst interfaces with existing systems to answer questions about the state of current or future business. The analyst might be asked to track our impact by assessing how many assets we covered and how much methane was reduced in any given year. Or, they might be asked how long it would take to cover all assets in a particular basin. They might work with R&D on our methane reduction methodology and presentations. They could even work with data to produce leads for the sales team, or track achieved revenue and costs on a monthly basis. The analyst also prepares presentations for ESG, sales, and leadership at Kairos.

The analyst slices and dices information for operators (customers), investors, and internal teams. The ESG Data Analyst serves as the resident expert on how to quantify emissions reduction and they are constantly on the move answering questions across the company. Here’s an example of how the facts uncovered by the ESG Data Analyst are used by Kairos.

Required:

Python programming experience
Excel skills
Data analysis background
Detail-orientation with the ability to context switch easily, and juggle competing priorities
Mindfulness towards data fidelity

Gordon and Betty Moore established the foundation to create positive outcomes for future generations. In pursuit of that vision, we foster path-breaking scientific discovery, environmental conservation, patient care improvements and preservation of the special character of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Guided by this vision and the Statement of Founders' Intent, each day we strive to make a significant and positive impact on the world. We tackle large, important issues at a scale where we believe we can make significant and measurable impacts. We know that our ability to take risks and make long-term and relatively large commitments allows us to undertake challenges not accessible to many other organizations.

Foundation Facts
Headquartered in Palo Alto, CA
$9+ billion in assets
Annual foundation budget of over $300 million
About 100 employees
Four program areas: Environmental Conservation, Science, Patient Care, and the San Francisco Bay Area
Conservation and Markets Initiative

The Conservation and Markets Initiative seeks to advance conservation by delinking food production from ecosystem degradation. To accomplish this with sufficient speed and at a meaningful scale, we aim to work with a critical mass of supply chain actors to change behavior and transform the markets for beef, leather, soy, and top-traded seafood. By shifting the production, sourcing, and financing for these key globally traded agriculture and seafood commodities, the threats from growing international demand can be reduced—averting habitat conversion, deforestation, and overfishing in their primary production regions and helping ensure that conservation can endure.

Together with our grantees, we are engaging with the private sector in:
Agriculture — improving soy and beef production in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado, and the Chaco in Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia, by shifting practices towards sustainable agricultural production of these globally traded commodities,
Seafood — protecting marine and coastal ecosystems by safeguarding the health and abundance of wild-capture fish stocks and improving aquaculture practices,
Finance — ensuring that financial institutions, who provide capital to companies involved in beef, soy and seafood commodities, routinely scrutinize the business consequences of deforestation and overfishing and develop incentives for companies to eliminate risks associated with deforestation, illegality and overfishing in their supply chains.
For more information about the Initiative, visit: Conservation and Markets Initiative

The Position

The Program Data Analyst provides essential support for the Conservation and Markets Initiative (CMI), facilitating grant and portfolio-level data and knowledge management across the CMI team, and tracking and prioritizing key information to support decision-making and Initiative oversight. This position works closely with the CMI team and, secondarily, the foundation’s Adaptive Management and Evaluation team on grant and Initiative-level monitoring & evaluation (M&E) data collection, analysis, and learning.

The position is based at foundation headquarters in Palo Alto, California; however due to the COVID-19 pandemic, foundation offices are closed until at least January 1, 2022, and work will initially occur remotely.

Key Responsibilities
Take the lead, in coordination with CMI’s Program Director and Program Officers, on maintaining its core information management tool and supporting data that tracks grant outcomes and financial allocations to CMI’s Theory of Change and Initiative-level targets to support decision-making and oversight of CMI.
Ensure relevant Initiative-level indicators are appropriately represented in grants as they are developed by CMI’s Program Director and Program Officers.
Work with the CMI team and relevant grantees on M&E data requirements and timely data submission.
Train grantees on the use of CMI M&E data collection systems.
Continuously assess and ensure the quality and consistency of incoming M&E data.
During peak grantmaking periods, provide backup support to the CMI team in the grant development process, including the coordination of new grant, SCP, and DCA document development and submission.
In partnership with the CMI Operations Associate, coordinate CMI team strategy meetings by drafting and maintaining agendas, preparing and distributing meeting notes and synthesis documents, and articulating and following up on tasks to be completed by team members as the Initiative’s grantmaking strategy and operations evolve.
Participate with CMI team in preparation of annual target-setting and indicator documents for ECP and the wider foundation.
Manage, with input from CMI’s Program Director and Program Officers, CMI’s highlights/lowlights and work products documents with notable data, analysis, and stories as they present themselves throughout a given year.

Our mission is to exponentially improve drug development and the practice of medicine by learning from the care journey of every patient. We do it by developing novel AI and data pipelining technologies that can connect medical centers across the world and make sense of both unstructured and structured clinical data.

There have been many failed attempts to build a similar platform leaving the clinical and research community with one of two options: breadth with low fidelity (structured data) or high fidelity without breadth and scale (brute force abstraction of unstructured data). Our IP is a foundational breakthrough that can understand clinical context at scale and have been validated by marquee pharma and data companies.



The Data Integration Engineer will be responsible for bringing data together from different systems. Work closely with the sales team on pre-sales demo implementations, work in an agile development environment, will have to script data transformations based on pilot customer needs.

There are two things more devastating than learning that you or your loved ones have a terminal illness; getting the wrong treatment or not finding any. At Mendel, we are on a sincere mission to solve many never-solved-before technology challenges that can enable prescribers and drug makers to do their best.

We are also a fast growing Silicon Valley startup that has raised more than $20M from blue chip venture firms, with revenues more than doubling year to year, tons of benefits, on-site gym, child care, educational leaves, mentorship programs and commuter benefits.

As an Autopilot Software Engineer you will be responsible for collecting high quality data from our fleet of cars and presenting that data to key decision makers both inside and outside of the company. You will act as a champion to promote best practices in data integrity, metric design, feature validation, and documentation. You will use existing data and distinguish signal from noise, as well as design new metrics and collection methods when existing data is insufficient. Your work will affect millions of cars, as well as support the initiatives of many internal Tesla teams. We believe an autonomous future is a safer future, so success means shipping excellent, well validated features with a sense of urgency.

You Will
Build and own data frameworks and pipelines that support measuring fleetwide performance, safety statistics, and feature development
Design and implement new metrics and signals for evaluating Autopilot performance
Use data that you collect to build comprehensive, accurate reports of Autopilot feature performance and present your findings to both internal and external stakeholders
Work with stakeholders to take a vague problem statement, identify where data can be useful, and use the results to drive informed decisions
Productionize dashboards to be used across the entire team
Provide ad-hoc support in creating visualizations to help engineers make informed decisions
We Are Looking For Candidates With
BS or higher in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering or equivalent practical engineering experience
Proven track record of exceptional ability (i.e., you personally solved difficult problems that moved the needle on meaningful projects)
Strong proficiency in Python, SQL
Strong foundation in statistics
Experience with building data infrastructure (e.g., designing architecture, setting up databases, building data pipelines, implementing scalable monitoring) and implementing reporting solutions
Experience with data science tools such as Pandas, Numpy, R, etc.
Experience building data visualizations
Experience writing software in a production environment
Strong problem solving, critical thinking, and communication skills (both verbal and written)
