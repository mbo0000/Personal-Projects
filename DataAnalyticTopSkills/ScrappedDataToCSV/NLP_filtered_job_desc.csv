2744687527,"See who Kairos Aerospace has hired for this role Direct message the job poster from Kairos Aerospace At Kairos Aerospace, we combine innovative aerospace systems with advanced data science. Unlike traditional aerospace companies, we sell information, not hardware - we operate our sensors cost-effectively at continental scale to produce novel data streams about pressing global problems. First on our list: spotting hard-to-monitor emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change. Since starting continuous survey operations in 2018, Kairos has removed methane emissions equal to over 9.2 million tonnes of CO2e through our work. To put that in perspective, that’s equivalent to over 2 million cars being removed from the roads for a year or shutting down about seventeen 350 MW coal-fired power plants. As a team, we love science and engineering, we love getting our hands dirty with hardware and software, and we love seeing our work make a difference in the real world. We’ve created a diverse, collaborative, supportive, and fun environment based on integrity and treating people right. So no matter your gender, gender identity, race, age, beliefs, sexual orientation, or disabilities, we welcome you and would like to work with you. :-) It’s never boring, it’s always challenging, and we’re usually laughing. The underlying strength of Kairos’ Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) value proposition is the scale of our coverage. In 2021 Kairos will perform basin-wide analyses in the Permian, DJ, San Juan, San Joaquin, Barnett, and potentially the Anadarko basin. Since starting continuous operations in 2018, we’ve taken the equivalent of over 3.2 M cars off the road. The scope of ESG data analysis will only grow as Kairos scales with all ESG products needing to meet Kairos’ data fidelity standards. The ESG Data Analyst is a strategist who uses Kairos data to produce important facts, numbers, and information for teams across the company. As such, their work touches most departments and executives. This is a high impact position. Our ESG Data Analyst interfaces with existing systems to answer questions about the state of current or future business. The analyst might be asked to track our impact by assessing how many assets we covered and how much methane was reduced in any given year. Or, they might be asked how long it would take to cover all assets in a particular basin. They might work with R&D on our methane reduction methodology and presentations. They could even work with data to produce leads for the sales team, or track achieved revenue and costs on a monthly basis. The analyst also prepares presentations for ESG, sales, and leadership at Kairos. The analyst slices and dices information for operators (customers), investors, and internal teams. The ESG Data Analyst serves as the resident expert on how to quantify emissions reduction and they are constantly on the move answering questions across the company. Here’s an example of how the facts uncovered by the ESG Data Analyst are used by Kairos.

We know that our ability to take risks and make long-term and relatively large commitments allows us to undertake challenges not accessible to many other organizations. Four program areas: Environmental Conservation, Science, Patient Care, and the San Francisco Bay Area The Conservation and Markets Initiative seeks to advance conservation by delinking food production from ecosystem degradation. To accomplish this with sufficient speed and at a meaningful scale, we aim to work with a critical mass of supply chain actors to change behavior and transform the markets for beef, leather, soy, and top-traded seafood. By shifting the production, sourcing, and financing for these key globally traded agriculture and seafood commodities, the threats from growing international demand can be reduced—averting habitat conversion, deforestation, and overfishing in their primary production regions and helping ensure that conservation can endure. Together with our grantees, we are engaging with the private sector in: Agriculture — improving soy and beef production in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado, and the Chaco in Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia, by shifting practices towards sustainable agricultural production of these globally traded commodities, Seafood — protecting marine and coastal ecosystems by safeguarding the health and abundance of wild-capture fish stocks and improving aquaculture practices, Finance — ensuring that financial institutions, who provide capital to companies involved in beef, soy and seafood commodities, routinely scrutinize the business consequences of deforestation and overfishing and develop incentives for companies to eliminate risks associated with deforestation, illegality and overfishing in their supply chains.
